                                event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption,
                                resource contention, etc. The handler is not called
                                if the container crashes or exits. The reason for
                                termination is passed to the handler. The Pod''s termination
                                grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hooked
                                is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler,
                                the container will eventually terminate within the
                                Pod''s termination grace period. Other management
                                of the container blocks until the hook completes or
                                until the termination grace period is reached. More
